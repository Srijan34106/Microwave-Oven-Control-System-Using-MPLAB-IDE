# Microwave-Oven-Control-System-Using-MPLAB-IDE
This project implements a microwave oven control system using MPLAB IDE and a PIC microcontroller (PIC16F877A).The system is designed to manage different types of cooking mode inlcuding- MIcro, Grill, Convention, Start mode, managing cooking time, regulating power levels, and safety mechanisms efficiently.

Key Features:
-> User Interface – Uses buttons or a keypad for input (power level, cooking time).
-> Display System – LCD/LED display to show remaining time and status.
-> Motor Control – Controls turntable rotation for even heating.
-> Heating Mechanism – Simulates magnetron operation through relay control.
-> Safety Features – Ensures door lock detection and overheating protection.
-> Buzzer Alerts – Notifies when cooking is complete.

Technologies Used:
-> MPLAB IDE – For code development and debugging.
-> PICSIM LAB - For simulation purposes.
-> Embedded C – Firmware written for real-time operations.

This project demonstrates real-world embedded system applications, particularly in home appliances. It showcases microcontroller-based control, sensor integration, and user interaction, making it an ideal learning project for embedded systems enthusiasts.
